I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2013, I moved out to Boston to study computer science at Northeastern University. Since then, I've done a lot of moving back and forth for work and whatnot. At the time of this writing (December 2016), I'm currently living in Boston, though that will change mid-2017.

I have two main interests: climbing and programming. If you've found this website, odds are you're interested in at least one of these as well.

For climbing, I have a heavy focus on training (I'm always down to talk about my training schedule). I'm interested in climbing hard boulders. I also compete as part of the Northeastern University Climbing Team.

For programming, I consider myself a pretty well-rounded generalist. I started programming about ten years ago, intending to make games. Since then, I've worked on websites, an iOS app, infrastructure at big companies like Seagate and Google, and side projects of varying focuses. I'm currently pursuing my interest in robotics, and I'll be starting work at Piaggio Fast Forward in January 2017.
