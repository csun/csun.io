I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and graduated from Northeastern University in December 2017. I spent some time in Boulder before ending up in Seattle, where I currently work for [Unity](https://unity.com/). In my free time, I climb rocks, play music, film dumb videos, and otherwise explore other varied interests. I'm always looking for something to keep busy with, and enjoy finding little side projects to devote my time to.
