	<p>
	I wrote my first lines of code at age 10, and I've been programming ever
	since. I'm interested in using my experience to build things that people
	find useful.

	I believe that seeing things clearly is one of the most important skills a
	person can have. Better decisions can be made when a situation is thoroughly
	understood.
