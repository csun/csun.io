I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2013, I moved out to Boston to study computer science at Northeastern University. If all goes as planned, I will be graduating this year (2017) in December. During my time at Northeastern, I've had the opportunity to do quite a few cool things. Highlights include working at Google, building robots at Piaggio Fast Forward, and being captain of the NU Climbing Team.

After graduation, I will be looking for a full-time software engineering position in robotics, computer vision, or a related field. I think that we are on the verge of many new breakthroughs in how computers are used to interact with the physical world. I'm excited about pursuing these breakthroughs, and hope to do so through my future jobs. If you're hiring in one of these fields (or know someone who is), feel free to take a look at me [resume](/resume.pdf) and contact me about any openings.

When not programming, I spend most of my time rock climbing, playing music, filming silly videos, or otherwise exploring my other random interests. I'm always looking for something to keep busy with, and enjoy finding little side projects to devote my time to. If I ever remember to update my [blog](/blog), you can potentially read about my exploits there!
